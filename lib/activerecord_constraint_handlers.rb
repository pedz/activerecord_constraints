    # Constraint Handlers is a module to catch and handle the
    # exceptions produced by failed constraints.  The current
    # implementation ties only to the create_or_update path which is
    # after validations are done.  This allows the database to have
    # constraints but preserve the API and semantics of Model.save and
    # Model.save!
    #
    # The three hooks made available is a hook when the connection is
    # first created.  At that point, the database adapter specific
    # module is loaded into the base.  It does not work to rummage
    # around in the database during this hook.  This hook is done via
    # ConstraintConnectionHook.
    #
    # The second hook is done by the adapter specific constrait
    # handler.  The call to create_or_update is captured.  If an
    # exception is thrown, then the adapter specific
    # handle_create_or_update_exception is called.
    #
    # The third hook is also in the create_or_update.  Before the call
    # to create_or_update_witout_constraints is done, the class
    # specific pre_fetch method is called.  Again, this method is
    # included into the class of the model at the time the connection
    # is created.
